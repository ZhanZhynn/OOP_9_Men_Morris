## Sprint 2

Sprint 2 documentation deliverables can be accessed in the Sprint 2 folder, while code deliverables are stored in the Nine_Mens_Morris folder.

Inside the Sprint 2 folder we have:

**Submission Files (to be marked)**
1. 9MM_UML.pdf - our uml diagram for Sprint 2
2. FIT3077_Sprint_2_Design_Rationale.pdf - our design rationale for Sprint 2

**To run our 9MM game, please follow the steps below:**
1. Clone the GitLab repository
2. Set up JavaFX in Intellij. You may reference this [video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiAxeq42Mn-AhXk1TgGHWZkCUAQwqsBegQICBAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIvsvjUq38Jc&usg=AOvVaw0gUcKQI4-TAIw965WQCYux) or JavaFX's [website](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) if necessary.
3. Set up VM configuration for JavaFX and run from there.

*Attempt was made to create a jar file for the game, but it was unsuccessful. Hence, the game can only be run from Intellij.*


If the game runs successfully, you will see the interface below:

**Troubleshoot** <br>
If you face the error as shown below, it is likely that you have not set up JavaFX path correctly. Kindly update your path according to
where you saved your JavaFX SDK.

This configuration can be found in the VM options of the Run/Debug Configurations.
